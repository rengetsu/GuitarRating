# GuitarRatingApp
Guitar Shop Rating system app for guitars selection. Created using Javascript/CSS/HTML as University project.

## How algorithm works
At the beginning, all the pictures that will participate in the rating are assigned numbers, after which they are displayed in turn, two pieces on the screen.
You are given 2 pictures to choose from and you choose the one that you liked the most, after which its rating increases.
When pressed, the next pair is immediately displayed, and when all pairs have passed, they begin to be displayed in random order, thereby mixing them together.
Also, by pressing the button, you can display a table with ratings of all guitars on the screen.
